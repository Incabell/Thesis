Peter is a mid-fifties software engineer who has been working in the industry for so long, not much can phaze him. He doesn't really appreciate hectic surroundings and prefers it to be quiet so he can work efficiently. He's in control of the software department at his company and runs everything steadily. He believes that slow and steady wins the race although he is not opposed to improvements. His day is usually pre-structured and he avidly avoids makes any chances to it. It doesn't necessarily bother him. He is a very calm and stable person and there isn't much that can shake him up. He has been editing Wikipedia articles for 6+ years but never really got into it. He never liked how everyone could just come in and change everything. He often finds that the guidelines for the english Wikipedia aren't strict enough or at least not enforced rigurously enough. In the last couple of years he discovered template creation for himself. Usually no one tampers with his templates and everyone uses them when making an article which makes him feel good. When people want changes it'll be discussed before they are put in place so it's not as much out of control like an article would be. The only thing that worries him when it comes to being able Wikidata from the VisualEditor is that people will want to change loads of templates significantly. Other than that he is not opposed to the idea of it.
