\begin{quote}
"In en-wiki, there is no way any ordinary editor would have the slightest clue when creating an article that wikidata even exists and even less than the slightest clue how to create it. I've been editing nine years, nothing to help me other than talk page chitchat and completely incomprehensible instructions. Wiki markup syntax is complex enough for non-programmers, to go to a different web site and input something is too steep a learning curve for me..."

\noindent
Jeff - Male - 44 years old - history teacher at a highschool in seattle, washington \\
Married to Judy for 10 years - they have no kids \\
likes to go hiking and bird observation \\
in his free time he likes to edit wikipedia articles and organises editing sessions in his community \\
he knows of wikidata but has trouble using it \\

After a nice evening enjoying dinner with his wife judy, jeff wants to have a relaxed evening. He doesn't enjoy watching tv much unless there is a specific movie or documentary showing that he knows he will enjoy. He rather spends his spare time expanding free knowledge by editing on his local Wikipedia. He especially loves the almost 35 pages he made by now about birdspecies that are common in his region that he keeps up to date and vandalism free. He is not a programmer so it took him a long time to understand the Wikipedia markup language. But he's been editing for over 8 years so by now he feels very confident when using it. And fortunately since December 2012 he can use the visual editor which makes it much easier for him to maintain his pages. He loves the idea of Wikidata and would love to see the community use it more avidly but he struggles with the usage and thus refers to the old ways where he feels more comfortable. In the community meetups that he organizes there is also no one he can ask for help.
