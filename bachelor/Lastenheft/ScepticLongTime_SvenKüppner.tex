Sven is a 28 year old male who works as an accountant in a big company. He is the younger brother of two and always strives to be as successfull as his older brother. He doesn't like the level of responsibility he has at work and always tries to impress everyone with his knowledge. Usually his co-workers ignore what he has to say or don't take it to seriously. That really upsets Sven but he feels like he's powerless against it. He feels like he's really good at his job and deserves a promotion. He wishes that his co-workers would aknowledge his abilities and thus would look up to him more. When his brother was his age he was already head of a department of his company. That really bothers him. 
When he gets home from work he tries to meet a friend for drinks but he's busy. He feels like lately his friends have less and less time for him because they all seem to be so occupied with their jobs and their relationships. Since his relationship ended two years ago, he has had a hart time meeting the right person. This only adds up to his frustration. He knows that it isn't helathy but he doesn't know what to do about it. Even in his editing community he isn't very respected and he's been editing for over 6 years. He likes to participate in discussion because he feels like that way he can make a change, but often the reaction to his comments isn't very positive. 
He hates it when people mess with his articles. He doesn't like sharing the editing powers although he knows that Wikipedia is a community contribution but he feels like it's almost a personal violation when his words are being edited. He usually maintains the english and german Wikipedia articles and is often annoyed that he has to retype the change twice when things change. He is very sceptical about the infobox information coming from Wikidata but on the other hand it would really relieve him from a lot of typing.
