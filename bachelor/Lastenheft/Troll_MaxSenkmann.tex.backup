Max is a bright kid but had not the best upbringing and was not tought how to deal with all his feelings. All he really seeks is a group that he can belong to. He thinks he constantly needs to impress people for them to like him, otherwise they'll just leave. He definitely has abandonement issues which are unresolved. When he has no outlet and feels alone he tried to trigger any human reactions or interactions possible. For him trolling is an easy way to establish a connection. He recently discovered that vandalising articles on Wikipedia can be fun and triggers peoples reactions easily, and it all occurs anonymously. He knows he's not gaining anyones respect with that but at least it's some acknowledgement that he exists. He doesn't really know where his life is leading. He is in his last year of highschool now and has no plans for later. Highschool is quite easy for him although he could have much better grades if he would take it all more seiously and wouldn't mess about with his friends so much.
