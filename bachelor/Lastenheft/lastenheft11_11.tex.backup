\section{Initial situation}

\subsection{Why this project and how did this idea develope?}

Wikidata is notoriously underused and urgently needs a user-interface that will allow all kinds of users to integrate Wikidata into their wikiscript. This will be an important step use Wikidata to it's full potential.

\subsection{How was the problem resolved in the past?}

Currently the only way to edit the data from a client is a 'hack'. There is no good actual clean way to do this which is why it is so underused. 

\subsection{Why is there need for action?}

Because currently it by far isn't being used to the extent it was intendet to and because the community is unhappy with the way it is currently usable which is basically no way.

\subsection{Rough desired course of action?}

Determine, through user-centered design, a user-interface which will allow for editing from a client. 


\section{Objective}

\subsection{What should be achieved in the end?}

Improving the client editing experience and actually making it possible from the client directly.

\subsection{On what can the success be measured?}

Increase in number of infoboxes filled with data from wikidata on wikipedia.

\subsection{What has to happen so the solution can be realised?}

My thesis.

\section{Operational environment}

\subsection{Under which circumstances will the product be used?}

Anytime an editor wants to change or add or remove information from the infobox in Wikidata.

\newpage

\subsection{Define the target group}
\subsubsection{Personas}

Currently in personas.tex

\subsection{What is the product supposed to achieve and be able to do?}

See table for now.

\section{Non-functional requirements}

\begin{itemize}
 \item vandalism should be surpressed
 \item locality (user must know where he is editing)
 \item sense of ownership for the WD community
 \item entry barrier must be lowered
 \item user must know what he is doing and what consequences it'll have

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Should the product be extendable?}

Yes. It should be so each local wiki can add or alter the appearence and certain parts of the functions. maybe even editors can customise it a bit?

\subsection{Should alterations be possible?}

Yes.

\subsection{What are the usability requirements?}

This still needs to be determined.


\section{Functional requirements}

\subsection{Which functions must exist?}

\hline
MUST & SHOULD & COULD  \\ \hline
preview how changes would look & notice when infobox not from wikidata and suggest & little info floating boxes \\ \hline
only show statements that are in the template anyway & labels probably should be editable to reverse vandalism on WD & suggest properties when adding or editing \\ \hline
two different input methods &  & admin maybe has right to disable WD in specific infobox due to complexity and the redirect to WD \\ \hline
integrate with visual editor &  &  \\

\section{Interfaces}

\subsection{Explanations (H-C, C-C...)}

Visual editor. The normal editor.

\section{Quality requirements}

\subsection{Which quality characteristics should be fullfilled?}
